# advanced_botnet
Features
1. Self-Maintaining Process Killer
The botnet includes an advanced process-killing mechanism that autonomously searches for and terminates suspicious processes. It ensures that the bot's processes are not killed by other system operations. The process killer uses /proc to monitor active processes and can target processes based on specific criteria such as name and command-line arguments.

2. Command-Line Monitoring & Lockdown
This botnet features a command-line monitoring system that detects and kills processes using file transfer or system modification commands, such as:

wget
curl
ftpget
tftp
reboot
This prevents unauthorized activities on the system.

3. Directory-based Persistence with File Renaming
To ensure persistence, the botnet can rename itself in various writable directories (e.g., /tmp/, /var/, /dev/). It also replaces existing files to avoid detection by simple monitoring tools.

4. Advanced Memory Searching & Process Inspection
The botnet incorporates advanced memory scanning techniques to detect and match specific patterns in processes. It can also monitor process command lines and terminate processes that match predefined patterns.

5. Cross-Process Interaction and Resource Management
This botnet uses sophisticated techniques to interact with multiple processes and manage system resources, ensuring its operations remain undetected by conventional monitoring systems.
